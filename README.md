First and fore-most, this was initially a personal challenge to see whether I could implement most sorting algorithms in search for the best in terms of efficiency
and the ever-growing need to crunch huge(in millions) values of items searching
for something. But searching through un clustered data can be a pain the ass and in
most cases tends to be slow, thus the need to arrange/sort data before performing
any further operations on our dataset.
